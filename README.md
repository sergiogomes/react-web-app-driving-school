React Web App - Driving School

## Creating a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory youâ€™d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```sh
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"
```

Under the hood, this uses the tool called create-next-app, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you. It uses this template through the --example flag.

## Commands

Inside this directory, you can run several commands:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Starts the development server.

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production.

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the built app in production mode.
